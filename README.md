# Global requirements
0. Microsoft Azure account
1. Setup a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) tenant. You can follow this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
2. Create an `App registration` as a Single-page app. You can follow this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-register-ciam-app?tabs=spa)
3. On the created App registration, create `App roles` following this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps), with respective keys and values:
    ```javascript
    "Display name" = "Administrator"

    ```
4. On the left panel, under the `Manage` section go to the `Authentication` tab and add a Single-page application platform.
    - If this is your development instance you may want to add `http://localhost:3000` as your redirect URI
    - For production website use your static web app URI
    - Under the `Implicit grant and hybrid flows` section make sure that only `Access tokens (used for implicit flows)` is checked.

## Requirements to run this project locally
First, make sure that you completed all the steps described under the "Global requirements" section. Then, fill the `.env` file with respective keys and values.


> [!NOTE]
> If you have an instance of the API running on the Azure you may use the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_HOST` as your single API endpoint. However, if you want to run your Azure functions locally, fill the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PRIVATE_API_HOST`, `REACT_APP_BACKEND_FILES_API_HOST`, `REACT_APP_BACKEND_ADMIN_API_HOST`, `REACT_APP_BACKEND_SIGNALR_API_HOST` and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_NEWSLETTER_API_HOST` accordingly.

```javascript
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT = 'dev'
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_HOST = 'https://harck-{your-project-name}-api.azure-api.net'
#REACT_APP_BACKEND_PRIVATE_API_HOST = 'http://localhost:7071'
#REACT_APP_BACKEND_FILES_API_HOST = 'http://localhost:7072'
#REACT_APP_BACKEND_ADMIN_API_HOST = 'http://localhost:7073'
#REACT_APP_BACKEND_SIGNALR_API_HOST = 'http://localhost:7074'
#REACT_APP_BACKEND_NEWSLETTER_API_HOST = 'http://localhost:7075'

REACT_APP_TENANT_ID = 'MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_Directory_(tenant)_ID'
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/'
REACT_APP_API_SCOPE = 'Value from the scope obtained at the step 7. - Global requirements'
REACT_APP_USERNAME = "test-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME.onmicrosoft.com" /* only needed for Cypress integration - do not store any sensitive production data, such as passwords, on your .env file */
REACT_APP_PASSWORD = "user_password" /* only needed for Cypress integration */
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET = "SECRET_GENERATED_ON_STEP_5_GLOBAL_REQUIREMENTS" /* only needed for Cypress integration */

```

### Cypress
On this project Cypress is used to test the frontend integration with the backend, as well as some of the frontend functionalities.


You may find all Cypress tests under `HARCK-CMS-FE\cypress`. Cypress tests will only be executed if you provide a CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID. 

> [!WARNING]
> You may not want to execute it on your production environment. It executes actions that can add, edit and remove content!


For more information about Cypress go to the official [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction).


> [!WARNING]
> Before running any tests make sure you have completed all previous steps

To run the tests locally use: `npm run-script test`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
> [!NOTE]
> It was present with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) kit.
> this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Deploy online
